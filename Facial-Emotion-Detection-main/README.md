![Project Banner](https://i0.wp.com/sefiks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kid-expressions-cover.png?resize=459%2C409&ssl=1)

This project is a **Facial Emotion Recognition System** built using **Deep Learning** techniques. The model classifies human emotions based on facial expressions and provides real-time emotion detection via a **web application**.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Dataset:** FER2013 (Facial Emotion Recognition)

---

## **Features**

- Detects emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Fearful**, **Disgust**, and **Neutral** from facial expressions.
- Real-time emotion detection with a **web application** using **Flask**.
- Deep Learning Model built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
- Web interface for easy interaction with the model.

## **Project Overview**

### **Dataset**
The model is trained using the **FER2013 dataset**, which contains thousands of images labeled with seven emotion categories. The dataset is publicly available and widely used for emotion recognition tasks.

### **Model**
We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion classification. The model is trained on facial images to predict the emotion from each image.

### **Web Interface**
The Flask-based web app allows users to upload images, which are then processed by the model to detect the emotion. The detected emotion is displayed as output.
